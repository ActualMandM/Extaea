# Extaea
A file extractor for a Switch rhythm game.

## Compilation
In order to compile, you'll need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

Once it is installed, you just have to run the following command:
```
haxe build.hxml
```

Afterwards, the compiled file will be in `bin/bin/Main.exe`.

## Usage
Place `arc.json` and `arc.pack` in the same folder as `Main.exe`, then run `Main.exe`. The extracted files will be put into the data folder.
